# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection-
-----
##Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent online payment transactions by analyzing patterns in transaction data and using machine learning models to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent. The goal is to improve transaction security and reduce financial losses from fraud.

##Features
-Data Exploration: Identifies transaction patterns and trends associated with fraud.
-Feature Engineering: Selects and transforms relevant features to improve model performance.
-Machine Learning: Implements classification models to predict fraudulent transactions.
-Performance Evaluation: Uses metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to assess model accuracy.
##Tools and Technologies
-Programming Language: Python
-Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
##Project Workflow
-Data Preprocessing:
 -Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalization.
-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 -Visualized transaction distributions, identified correlations, and detected patterns indicative of fraud.
-Feature Engineering:
 -Selected key features to optimize model accuracy.
-Model Training:
 -Tested various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to find the best-performing model.
-Evaluation:
 -Assessed model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics.
